# Reporting Overview

*Released in TRMM v0.17.0 (Nov 1, 2023)*

The reporting addon allows you to access your Tactical RMM data and represent in the format
of your choice. This could be a PDF file, a simple csv, or a complex interactive web dashboard.

It is best to get started with using the [shared templates](https://github.com/amidaware/reporting-templates) and go from there (you can import these directly from the TRMM web UI with 1 click.) The pages below
will help you get familiar with the terminology and the syntax. 

Check back here frequently in the coming days/weeks/months as we will be constantly updating and improving the Reporting docs and adding video tutorials.
